A weather dashboard built with Power Apps!

This dashboard connects to the OpenWeather API through a custom connector (included in the solution). If you want to change the location, simply update the longitude and latitude variables in App OnStart and all the details on the dashboard will update accordingly.

Please remember to get your free API key on here - https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up - you do not need to pay, just register an account.

Hope you enjoy playing around with this fun project :)
